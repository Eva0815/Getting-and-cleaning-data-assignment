# Getting-and-cleaning-data-assignment
This repository contains all files for the peer-graded assignment of the getting and cleaning data coursera course.
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. A dataset is cleaned so that it can be used for further analysis.

The data used for this project were collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone in an experiment with 30 volunteers that performed six different activities wearing a smartphone on the waist. The data was partitioned in a training and a test dataset.
